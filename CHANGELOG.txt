    * dmidecode
    * lspci
    * lsusb
  + List of supported Profiles:
    * Profiles not useful yet, just use single tools in this release.
  + List of known defects (or lack of features):
    * Fails to run second -t or -p, only first -p or t run.
    * Check if tool exists before spawning it, and catch errno2 properly.
    * Generate sha256sum-compatible manifest.txt with hashes of all
      generated files.
    * Exception handling code needs improving, some exceptions not logged
      or recovered properly, scope of exceptions insufficient.
    * Profile code does not work well, use a single tool at at time for M1
    * If CHIPSEC install does not support "chipsec_main", and only works
      with "python -m chipsec_main", on the local system, then the chipsec
      commands will not work.
