=========

2018/03/25
 + Version 0.0.1-PRE-ALPHA, aka Milestone 1 (M1)
 + Initial release. Not ready for most users. :-)
 + List of requirements: 
    * Intel x64 UEFI system
    * Debian/Ubuntu-based Linux
    * CPython v2.7x
 + List of supported Tools:
    * CHIPSEC (a few tools)
    * FWTS (a few tools)
    * acpidump
    * dmidecode
    * lspci
    * lsusb
  + List of supported Profiles:
    * Profiles not useful yet, just use single tools in this release.
  + List of known defects (or lack of features):
    * Fails to run second -t or -p, only first -p or t run.
    * Check if tool exists before spawning it, and catch errno2 properly.
    * Generate sha256sum-compatible manifest.txt with hashes of all
      generated files.
    * Exception handling code needs improving, some exceptions not logged
      or recovered properly, scope of exceptions insufficient.
    * Profile code does not work well, use a single tool at at time for M1
    * If CHIPSEC install does not support "chipsec_main", and only works
      with "python -m chipsec_main", on the local system, then the chipsec
      commands will not work.
