Firmware Audit (FWAudit) README.txt:

Before using this tool, please read at least the files: USERGUIDE.txt,
CHANGELOG.txt, and LICENSE.txt. You can skip the last file if you have
undstand the GNU/GPLv2 license.

Please also check the web page and announce list to ensure you have the
latest release of the tools, and check for any new security issues before
using. And backup all data on the system.

See the list of supported tools in the CHANGELOG (eg, CHIPSEC, FWTS,
acpidump, etc.): you need to have at least some of those tools installed for
FWAudit to be useful. Most of the needed tools are not pre-installed on most
vanilla OS releases; many have no packaging, and must be built from source.

If you have a problem, look for a listing in the needed tasks section of
HACKING.txt, and the Github-based issue tracking system, and for 'XXX'- and
'FIXME'-tagged comments in the source code for any known issues.

Developer-contributors: patches gladly accepted for anything in HACKING.txt,
or more Pythonic improvements to current code.

Thanks!
