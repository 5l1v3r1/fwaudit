Platform Firmware Auditing Tool

This tool incorporates CHIPSEC and a variety of other software tools to provide an audit of platform firmware. The audit is as complete as possible - for instance, CHIPSEC currently does much more on Intel systems than AMD.

There is currently no support for ARM based systems.
